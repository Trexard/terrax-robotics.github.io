# Terrax Robotics

**Modular robots. Field-ready design. Human-centered engineering.**

Terrax Robotics is a small independent engineering team based in Germany.  
We focus on modular robot platforms, creative mechatronics, and mission-ready prototypes.

We believe in learning by building, and in building with purpose.  
Every machine we create carries our signature: curiosity and solder.
